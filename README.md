# Cyber Portfolio

Hands-on security labs, notes, and writeups. Focus: detection, Windows logging, basic web vulns, and safe red-team practice in containers/VMs.

## Directory Map
- `labs/` hands-on projects with reproducible steps
- `writeups/` HTB/THM style reports
- `scripts/` small utilities
- `SOPs/` how I run labs, opsec, and repeatable workflows
- `notes/weekly-logs/` what I did each week

## Running Labs
Each lab has:
- `README.md` with goals, architecture, steps, teardown
- `artifacts/` pcaps, logs, screenshots
- `detectors/` rules, queries, or scripts

## Ethics
Only legal targets. No real credentials or client data. Red-team labs run locally.
